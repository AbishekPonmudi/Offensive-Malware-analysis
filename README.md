Windows API Hooking and DLL Injection are techniques commonly utilized by Offensive Security teams to gain deeper insights into system behavior. In this context, Iâ€™ve developed a custom EDR solution to assist with malware analysis and threat detection, which you can explore in this repository [Refer here](https://github.com/abishekponmudi/threat-intelligence-platform). This repository is designed to analyze malware, identify suspicious activities, and monitor various Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) employed by adversaries. By analyzing these behaviors, the EDR aims to proactively protect systems against evolving threats. The repository includes detailed analysis tools, providing actionable intelligence to fortify system defenses."
